Colloquy CTCP Sounds

Basic script for Colloquy that accepts CTCP sound requests and plays them for you.

Warning: This script was created in 2009 and has not been touched or looked at since.
It's a very simple script, so I'm guessing it still works to some degree, but I don't
have the time to test it out right now.
